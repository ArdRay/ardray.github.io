Another interesting fact that came up with the processing of SSH banners which were captured on March 2013, is the amount of hosts using deprecated versions of SSH.

Out of **1900734** IPs, the results are the following:

| SSH Version       | Number of Hosts |
|---                |---              |
| 2.0               | 1678331         |
| 1.99              | 172907          |
| 1.5               | 21281           |
| 1.4               | 6               |
| 1.3               | 2               |
| modified version  | 13              |

Modified versions included heavy alterations of the SSH banner, such as “SSH Secret” and “SSH 4.00”.
